Purcell, Clare

The Money allocated for the CB&S included the development of a tracking system on
¢nvironmenta| activities in Europe. PM, igh

Contracted t Org to track similar activities, we essentially put the Covington Program
on

I would recommend that Debbie decides whether Or not we require to monitor activitics in
Europe or not and who should be doing the monitoring. With the budget constraints in the
KIS org I am not certain

if the ERM Project remains active, | Suspect that Debbie will want to monitor critical
€nvironmental issues worlwide. With her established links to the food Organizations
worldwide, she Probably already has a system in place.
