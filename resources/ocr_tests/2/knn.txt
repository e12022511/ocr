RE: Intemational Compliance-Legal
Purcell, Clare

The money allocated for the CB&S included the development of a tracking system on
environmental activitics in Europe. Because PM, through the KJS organization, had
contracted the ERM Org to track similar activities, we essentially put the Covington program
on hold.

I would recommend that Debbie decides whether or not we requirc to monitor activities in
Europe or not and who should be doing the monitoring. With the budget constraints in the
KJS org I am not certain

if the ERM project remains active. 1 suspect that Debbie will want to monitor critical
environmental issues worlwide. With her established links to the food organizations
worldwide, she probably already has a system in place.
